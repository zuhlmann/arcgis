# Reset Required Fields
**Note: This tool applies to working with Hosted Feature Services in ArcGIS Online or Portal. If you're working with ArcGIS Server Feature Services there is a different workflow to utilize, please go [here](https://support.esri.com/en/Technical-Article/000022706).**

Sets the "required" fields to be null rather than white-space or 0 in the service definition template information.

Supported in ArcGIS Pro 2.0+

Fields are said to be "required" in ArcGIS Collector if the field is not nullable. In the template information in the layer definition file, some of these fields are set to blank white-space (" ","") or to 0. These template values then auto-populate the fields in the Collector app meaning the end-user doesn't have to enter anything, when in reality, they should be forced to enter a value.
