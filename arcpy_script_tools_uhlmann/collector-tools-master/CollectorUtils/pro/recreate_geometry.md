# Recreate Geometry
Assigns geometrical attributes to the geometry of a point (X, Y, Z), and creates a new feature class. Used when using GNSS GPS receivers with Collector to re-populate the Z-values in the correct coordinate system.

Supported in ArcGIS Pro 2.0+

This tool is used convert attributes to geometries. The main use case for this is when using GNSS GPS receivers with the collector app, the meta data is stored (receiver name, lat, long, altitude, accuracy...) in the attribute table but the 3D z-values may not be projected properly when stored in the database. 

Suppose you have feature that has the following attributes where the geometry (X and Y) of the features has been projected to NAD83, but the Lat, Long, and Z attributes are still in WGS84. 

| ObjectID | Shape   | Lat       | Long        | Z         |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1        | Point   | 34.057866 | -117.196879 | 369.05957 |

This tool will create a new feature class that uses the Lat, Long, and Z attributes to create the geometry (using the orginal projection: WGS84). It carries over any other attributes as well.

### Run the tool within ArcGIS Pro:

1. Connect to the folder containing the "CollectorUtils_Pro" toolbox
2. Double click on the "CollectorUtils_Pro" toolbox that should be shown in the catalog/project area
3. Double click the "Recreate Geometry" script tool (in the "GeneralUtils" toolset)
4. Choose your inputs
    1. Input Features - This is the point feature class that you would like to update the geometry of and project
    2. Input Coordinate System - This is the Coordinate System of the X (long), Y (long), and Z (altitude) values. NOT necessarily the CS of the feature class
    3. X-Value Coordinates - The field that stores the X values or Longitude information (attempts to auto-populate)
    4. Y-Value Coordinates - The field that stores the Y values or Latitude information (attempts to auto-populate)
    5. Z-Value Coordinates - The field that stores the Z values or Elevation/Altitude information (attempts to auto-populate)
    6. Output Features - The location of the output feature class
5. Click Run

### Using as a standalone script
Run the [recreate_geometry.py](scripts/recreate_geometry.py) script in either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+
```python
    python recreate_geometry.py <FQP to feature class> <input spatial reference as string> <x-field> <y-field> <z-field> <FQP to output feature class>
```

Example:
```python
    python recreate_geometry.py "C:/Temp/Temp.gdb/Test" "GEOGCS['GCS_WGS_1984',DATUM['D_WGS_1984',SPHEROID['WGS_1984',6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM['Greenwich',0.0],UNIT['Degree',0.0174532925199433]],VERTCS['WGS_1984',DATUM['D_WGS_1984',SPHEROID['WGS_1984',6378137.0,298.257223563]],PARAMETER['Vertical_Shift',0.0],PARAMETER['Direction',1.0],UNIT['Meter',1.0]]" "ESRIGNSS_LONGITUDE" "ESRIGNSS_LATITUDE" "ESRIGNSS_ALTITUDE" "C:/Temp/Output.gdb/Output3"
```

### What it does
1. Checks that all of the specified fields exist
2. Creates a new feature class
3. Creates new features in the feature class by iterating through the features of the input feature class

### Additional Notes
- Running this tool by itself does not maintain existing attachments on the output feature class. You will need to also run the Maintain Attachments tool also. Both of these tools are included inside the ProjectZ model tool. 
- This tool also does not maintain user-defined related tables on the output feature class. Those relationship classes will need to be recreated for the output feature class. You can follow the same properties from the existing relationship class from the input layer.
